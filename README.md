# Simple Drawing Checker

A mini app to try to match angles, proportion and placement to improve your observation skills and hopefully drawing.

Try the demo [here](https://jasonify.github.io//Drawing-Checker).
## How it works

The idea is you first draw on the left side using the line tool.
Then you press the `Start Transfer` button and you'll now have your image on the right side. Once that is done you can now draw on the left again and try to match your own drawing on the right. You can press the `Check Work` which let's you see an underline of your work. To hide it again you can press `Hide Underline`. It supports undo and resetting both canvases at once.
